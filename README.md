# TGlobal
Think Global is a fictitious, not-for-profit organization in New Zealand that offers international exchange programs. 
An international exchange program is a program in which a person studies or works in a foreign country for a short time (e.g., one to six months). 
Think Global wants to develop a website to promote its initiative and reach new members. 

In this project, you will be working on your own implementation of a one-page website for Think Global. 
A one-page website is an alternative to the traditional design that includes multiple pages (Links to an external site.).  
The one-page website design fits on a single page, and there are no additional pages. 
One-page websites are suitable for sites that are not heavy on content and intended to showcase one main idea.  
To navigate to different destinations on a one-page website, 
users click navigation links that allow them to jump to destinations on the same page, or scroll down the page to reach different sections of content.
